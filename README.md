Developed a predictive model to forecast PM2.5 pollution levels using weather and temporal data.
Preprocessed data with feature scaling and categorical encoding, and split it into training, validation, and testing sets.
Built a single-layer LSTM model with 50 neurons using Adam optimizer and MAE loss function to handle target volatility.
Visualized training and validation metrics to ensure robust model performance.
Skills: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Time-Series Analysis, Data Preprocessing
Outcome: Improved accuracy in PM2.5 forecasting, enabling proactive environmental monitoring and decision-making.
